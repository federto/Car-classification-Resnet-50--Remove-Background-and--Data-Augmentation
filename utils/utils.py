    It's not always easy to track how Keras maps our dataset classes to
    the model outputs.
    Given an image, the model output will be a 1-D vector with probability
    scores for each class. The challenge is, how to map our class names to
    each score in the output vector.
    We will use this function to provide a class order to Keras and keep
    consistency between training and evaluation.

    ----------
    config : dict
        Experiment settings as Python dict.

    -------
    classes : list
        List of classes as string.

    This function will also return the true label for each image, to do so,
    the folder must be structured in a way in which images for the same

    Parameters
    ----------
    folder : str
        Path to the folder you want to process.

    model : keras.Model
        Loaded keras model.

    input_size : tuple
        Keras model input size, we must resize the image to math these

        List of classes as string. It allow us to map model output IDs to the
